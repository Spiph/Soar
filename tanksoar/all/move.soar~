## Move Operator Proposal
# If the task is tanksoar and the tank is not blocked in the forward
# direction, propose the move operator.
sp {tanksoar*propose*move
   (state <s> ^name tanksoar
              ^io.input-link.blocked.forward no)
-->
   (<s> ^operator <o> +)
   (<o> ^name move
        ^actions.move.direction forward)}

## Turn Operator Proposal
# If the tank is blocked in the forward direction, and not blocked in the
# right or left directions, then propose the turn operator for the unblocked
# direction. Also create an indifferent preference for the operator.
# This operator will also turn on the radar and set the radar-power to 13.
# If the tank is blocked in the forward direction, and in both the right or
# left directions, then propose the turn operator left.
